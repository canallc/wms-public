        <h5>1. SERVICES AND SOFTWARE</h5>
        <strong>1.1</strong> License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
        this Agreement, Company (a) will use commercially reasonable efforts to
        host, operate and maintain the warehouse management services and
        software as set forth on the accepted Invoice or signed Proposal, which

        (collectively, the “Solutions”), (b) grants Customer a non-exclusive,
        non-transferable, non-sublicensable right and license to access and use
        the Solutions and (c) grants Customer a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable
        and non-transferable license to use (i.e., to download and display
        locally) Content solely for purposes of using the Solutions. For
        clarity, unless otherwise specified by Company in writing, any and all
        rights or licenses granted by Company to Customer shall only apply to
        Customer and not Customer's affiliates, including, without limitation,
        any parent, subsidiary, or other entity controlled by or under common
        control with Customer.<br />
        ‍<br />
        <strong>1.2</strong> Access and Account Setup. Upon execution of an
        accepted Invoice or signed Proposal, Company will provide Customer with
        a unique login and password for each user to access the Solutions web
        pages which are hosted and maintained by Company. Customer shall not
        share login information with any persons other than authorized users and
        shall ensure that authorized users do not share login information with
        any unauthorized users. Customer shall be responsible for the acts or
        omissions of any person who accesses the Solutions using logins provided
        to or created by Customer. Company reserves the right to modify or
        discontinue any part of the Solutions at any time by giving thirty (30)
        days' prior written notice to Customer, provided that in the event such
        modification or discontinuance materially reduces the functionality of
        the Solutions, Customer may terminate this Agreement immediately. From
        time to time, Company personnel may log in to the Solutions under
        Customer's account in order to maintain or improve the Solution,
        including providing Customer assistance with technical or billing
        issues. Customer hereby acknowledges and consents to such access.<br />
        ‍<br />
        <strong>1.3</strong> Solution Availability. Company will use
        commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the Solution availability to
        send and receive data, subject to downtimes resulting from maintenance,
        repairs and upgrades. Company will attempt to notify Customer
        electronically in advance of any planned downtime. Notwithstanding the
        foregoing, Company will not be liable for any failures in the Solutions
        or any other problems which are related to (a) the Customer Content or
        (b) outages to any telecommunications or public Internet backbones,
        networks or servers, or other equipment or service outside of Company's
        facilities or control.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>1.4</strong> Solutions Support. Company will provide Customer
        with e-mail support for Customer's use of the Solutions during Company's
        warehouse operations hours. Customer agrees that Company is not
        responsible to provide support for any issues resulting from problems,
        errors or inquiries related to Customer's systems or hardware.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>1.5</strong> Customer Content. As used herein, the term
        “Content” includes, without limitation, information, data, text,
        photographs, software, scripts, graphics, and interactive features
        generated, provided, or otherwise made accessible on or through the
        Solutions, including without limitation all Customer Content (as defined
        below). All Content created through or submitted to the Solutions by
        Customer (collectively “Customer Content”) is the sole responsibility of
        Customer. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Company will not assume
        any, and hereby disclaims all responsibility and liability for Customer
        Content and any modifications thereto. Customer hereby grants Company a
        worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid-up license to use,
        reproduce, perform, display, modify, and distribute the Customer Content
        in connection with providing the Solutions to Customer.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>1.6</strong> Use Restrictions. Except as expressly permitted in
        this Agreement, Customer shall not directly or indirectly (a) use any of
        Company's Confidential Information (defined below) to create any
        service, software, documentation or data that is similar or competitive
        to any aspect of the Solutions, (b) disassemble, decompile, reverse
        engineer or use any other means to attempt to discover any source code
        of the Solutions, or the underlying ideas, algorithms or trade secrets
        therein, (c) encumber, sublicense, transfer, rent, lease, time-share or
        use the Solutions in any service bureau arrangement or otherwise for the
        benefit of any third party, (d) copy, harvest, scrape, distribute,
        manufacture, adapt, create derivative works of, translate, localize,
        port or otherwise modify any aspect of the Solutions, (e) use or allow
        the transmission, transfer, export, re-export or other transfer of any
        product, technology or information it obtains or learns pursuant to this
        Agreement (or any direct product thereof) in violation of any export
        control or other laws and regulations of the United States or any other
        relevant jurisdiction, (f) interfere or attempt to interfere with the
        proper working of the Solutions or any activities conducted on the
        Solutions, (g) remove any copyright patent, trademark, or other
        intellectual property notices, information, and restrictions contained
        in any Content accessed through the Solutions, or (h) permit any third
        party to engage in any of the foregoing proscribed acts.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>1.7</strong> Limitations. Company will not be responsible or
        liable for any failure in the Solutions resulting from or attributable
        to (a) Customer use of the Solutions not in accordance with this
        Agreement or any relevant documentation provided by Company, (b)
        failures in any telecommunications, network or other service or
        equipment outside of Company's or its service providers' facilities, (c)
        Customer's or any third party's products, services, negligence, acts or
        omissions, (d) any force majeure or other cause beyond Company's
        reasonable control, or (e) unauthorized access, breach of firewalls or
        other hacking by third parties.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>1.8</strong> Trial Services. If Customer is using a free trial,
        a proof of concept version of the Solutions, a beta version of the
        Solutions, or using the Solutions on any other free-of-charge basis as
        specified in an accepted Invoice or signed Proposal including any
        related support services to the extent provided by Company in its sole
        discretion (collectively, “Trial Services”), Company makes such Trial
        Services available to Customer until the earlier of: (i) the end of the
        free trial or proof of concept period or beta testing period as
        communicated by Company or specified in the accepted Invoice or signed
        Proposal; (ii) the start date of any purchased version of such Solution;
        or (iii) written notice of termination from Company (“Trial Services
        Period”). Company grants Customer, during the Trial Services Period, a
        non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access and use the Trial
        Services for Customer's internal evaluation purposes subject to the
        access and use restrictions set forth in this Agreement. Customer is
        authorized to use Trial Services only for evaluation and not for any
        business or productive purposes. Any data Customer enters into the Trial
        Services and any configurations made to the Trial Services by or for
        Customer during the term of such Trial Services will be permanently lost
        unless Customer: (a) has purchased a subscription to the same Solutions
        as covered by the Trial Services; or (b) exports such data or
        configurations before the end of such free period. There is no guarantee
        that features or functions of the Trial Services will be available, or
        if available will be the same, in the general release version of the
        Solutions, and Customer should review the Solutions features and
        functions before making a purchase. Company will be under no obligation
        to provide Customer any maintenance or support services with respect to
        the Trial Services. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Company
        provides the Trial Services “as is” and “as available” without any
        warranties or representations of any kind. To the extent permitted by
        law, Company disclaims all implied warranties and representations
        relating to the trial services, including, without limitation, any
        implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose
        and non-infringement. Customer assumes all risks and all costs
        associated with its use of the Trial Services. Customer's sole and
        exclusive remedy in case of any dissatisfaction or Company's breach of
        the Agreement with respect to such Trial Services is termination of the
        Trial Services. Any obligations on behalf of Company to indemnify,
        defend, or hold harmless under this Agreement are not applicable to
        Customers using Trial Services.<br />
        <br />
        <h5>2. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS</h5>
        ‍<br />
        Subject to the rights and licenses expressly granted hereunder, Customer
        shall retain all rights, title and interest (including all intellectual
        property and proprietary rights) in and to the Customer Content. Subject
        to the limited rights and licenses expressly granted hereunder, Company

        Content), all Company trademarks, names, logos, all copies,
        modifications and derivative works thereof, and all rights to patent,

        correction, change or modification to the Services, (b) evaluations, and
        (c) other feedback, information and reports provided to Company
        hereunder (collectively, “Feedback”), will be the property of Company,
        and Customer shall and hereby does assign any rights in such Feedback to
        Company. Customer agrees to assist Company, at Company's expense, in
        obtaining intellectual property protection for such Feedback, as Company
        may reasonably request. Company reserves all rights not expressly
        granted to Customer in this Agreement. Except for the limited rights and
        licenses expressly granted under this Agreement, nothing in this
        Agreement grants, by implication, waiver, estoppel, or otherwise, to

        granted by this Agreement, the receiving party shall not access, use or
        disclose any of the disclosing party's Confidential Information without
        its written consent, and shall use at least the standard of care used to
        protect its own Confidential Information, but not less than reasonable
        care to protect the disclosing party's Confidential Information,

        contractors.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>3.3</strong> Required Disclosure. Nothing herein shall prevent a
        receiving party from disclosing any Confidential Information as
        necessary pursuant to any applicable court order, law, rule or
        regulation; provided that prior to any such disclosure, the receiving
        party shall use reasonable efforts to (a) promptly notify the disclosing
        party (to the extent legally permitted) in writing of such requirement
        to disclose and (b) cooperate with the disclosing party in protecting
        against or minimizing any such disclosure or obtaining a protective
        order.<br />
        <br />
        <h5>4. PAYMENTS; TAXES</h5>

        copyrights, trademarks, contract rights, or any other intellectual
        property or proprietary rights, and (b) Customer shall not make
        available through the Solutions any Content that is disparaging,
        obscene, offensive, or otherwise inappropriate or that contains any
        viruses or any other harmful code.<br />
        <br />
        <h5>6. DISCLAIMERS</h5>
        ‍<br />
        EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 5.1 HEREIN, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
        PERMITTED BY LAW, THE SOLUTIONS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND COMPANY HEREBY
        DISCLAIMS (FOR ITSELF AND ITS SUPPLIERS) ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER
        EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN, WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES,
        INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE,
        NON-INFRINGEMENT, QUIET ENJOYMENT, INTEGRATION, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
        FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, RELIABILITY, OR THAT THEIR OPERATION WILL BE
        UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, AS WELL AS ALL WARRANTIES ARISING FROM
        COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR USAGE OF TRADE. COMPANY
        MAKES NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND THAT THE SOLUTIONS, OR ANY PRODUCTS OR
        RESULTS OF THE USE THEREOF, WILL MEET CUSTOMER'S OR ANY OTHER PERSON'S
        REQUIREMENTS, OPERATE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION, ACHIEVE ANY INTENDED RESULT,
        BE COMPATIBLE OR WORK WITH ANY SOFTWARE, SYSTEM, OR OTHER SERVICES, OR
        BE SECURE, ACCURATE, COMPLETE, FREE OF HARMFUL CODE, OR ERROR FREE.<br />
        <br />
        <h5>7. INDEMNIFICATION</h5>
        ‍<br />
        <strong>7.1</strong> Customer. Customer agrees to defend against and
        hold Company harmless from any claim by a third party that arises from
        or is related to (a) any Customer Content, (b) Customer's use of the
        Solutions in violation of this Agreement, and (c) Customer's negligence
        or willful misconduct.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>7.2</strong> Company. Company agrees to defend against and hold
        Customer harmless from any claim by a third party that Solutions
        infringe a valid U.S. patent (issued as of the Effective Date), or any
        copyright or trade secret, of such third party. If any part of the
        Services become or, in Company's opinion, is likely to become the
        subject of any injunction preventing its use as contemplated herein,
        Company may, at its option (1) obtain for Customer the right to continue
        using the Solutions or (2) replace or modify the Solutions so that such
        solutions become non-infringing. If (1) and (2) are not reasonably
        available to Company, Company may terminate this Agreement upon written
        notice to Customer and refund to Customer a prorated amount of any
        pre-paid fees. Company shall have no liability or obligation hereunder
        with respect to any claim to the extent based upon (i) any use of the
        Solutions not strictly in accordance with this Agreement or in an
        application or environment or on a platform or with devices for which it
        was not designed or contemplated, (ii) modifications, alterations,
        combinations or enhancements of the Solutions not created by or for
        Company, (iii) any Customer Content, or (iv) Customer's continuing
        allegedly infringing activity after being notified thereof. The
        foregoing states the entire liability of Company, and Customer's
        exclusive remedy, with respect to any actual or alleged violation of
        intellectual property rights by the Solutions, any part thereof or its
        use or operation.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>7.3</strong> Procedures. Any claim for indemnification hereunder
        requires that (a) the indemnified party provides prompt written notice
        of the claim and reasonable cooperation, information, and assistance in
        connection therewith, and (b) the indemnifying party shall have sole
        control and authority to defend, settle or compromise such claim. The
        indemnifying party shall not make any settlement that requires a
        materially adverse act or admission by the indemnified party without the
        indemnified party's written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
        delayed, conditioned or withheld). The indemnifying party shall not be
        liable for any settlement made without its prior written consent.<br />
        <br />
        <h5>8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h5>

        THIRD PARTIES PURSUANT TO SECTION 7 (INDEMNIFICATION), IN NO EVENT SHALL
        EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE CONCERNING THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT,
        REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ANY CLAIM OR ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT,

        USE, LOSS OR INACCURACY OF DATA, LOSS OF, OR COST OF PROCURING
        SUBSTITUTE TECHNOLOGY, GOODS OR SERVICES, (B) INDIRECT, PUNITIVE,
        INCIDENTAL, RELIANCE, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
        INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF BUSINESS, REVENUES, PROFITS AND
        GOODWILL OR (C) DAMAGES, IN THE AGGREGATE, IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNTS PAID
        BY CUSTOMER TO COMPANY HEREUNDER DURING THE SIX (6) MONTHS PRECEDING
        SUCH CLAIM, EVEN IF IT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
        DAMAGES. THESE LIMITATIONS ARE INDEPENDENT FROM ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF
        THIS AGREEMENT AND SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ANY REMEDY
        PROVIDED HEREIN.<br />

        <br />
        <strong>9.3</strong> Effects of Termination. Upon any expiration or
        termination of this Agreement, all corresponding rights, obligations and
        licenses of the parties shall cease, including but not limited to
        Customer's rights to use the Solutions, except that all obligations that
        accrued prior to the effective date of termination (including without
        limitation, all payment obligations) shall survive. The provisions of

        <br />
        <h5>10. GENERAL PROVISIONS</h5>
        ‍<br />
        <strong>10.1</strong> Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the
        entire agreement, and supersedes all prior negotiations or agreements
        (oral or written), between the parties regarding the subject matter
        hereof. Any inconsistent or additional terms on any related purchase
        order, confirmation or similar form, even if signed by the parties
        hereafter, shall have no effect under this Agreement. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>10.2</strong> Modification and Waiver. No change, consent or
        waiver under this Agreement will be binding on either party unless made
        in writing and physically signed by an authorized representative of both
        parties. The failure of either party to enforce its rights under this
        Agreement at any time for any period will not be construed as a waiver
        of such rights, and the exercise of one right or remedy will not be
        deemed a waiver of any other right or remedy.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>10.3</strong> Severability. If any provision of this Agreement
        is determined to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be
        limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this
        Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect and
        enforceable. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>10.4</strong> Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by
        and construed under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the
        United States without regard to conflicts of laws provisions thereof.
        Exclusive jurisdiction and venue for actions related to this Agreement
        will be the state and federal courts located Prince William County,
        Virginia, and both parties consent to the jurisdiction of such courts
        with respect to any such actions. Any legal suit, action, or proceeding
        arising out of or related to this Agreement or the licenses granted
        hereunder will be instituted exclusively in the federal courts of the
        United States or the courts of the Commonwealth of Virginia in each case
        located in the county of Prince William, and each Party irrevocably
        submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such suit,
        action, or proceeding.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>10.5</strong> Remedies. Except as specifically provided
        otherwise herein, each right and remedy in this Agreement is in addition
        to any other right or remedy, at law or in equity. Each party agrees
        that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of Section 3, the
        non-breaching party will suffer irreparable damage for which it will
        have no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, the non-breaching party
        shall be entitled to seek injunctive and other equitable remedies to
        prevent or restrain such breach or threatened breach, without the
        necessity of posting any bond.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>10.6</strong> Notices. All notices required under this Agreement
        will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given: (a) when
        delivered by hand; (b) three (3) days after being sent by registered or
        certified mail, return receipt requested and postage prepaid; (c) one
        (1) day after deposit with a nationally recognized overnight delivery or
        express courier service; or (d) when provided via email when the sender
        has received a delivery/read receipt. Notice to Company shall be sent
        to: kfairman@canallc.com and notices to Customer shall be sent to the
        address or email address listed in the Order Form.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>10.7</strong> Force Majeure. With the exception of Customer's
        payment obligations herein, neither party will be liable to the other
        party for any delay or failure to perform which is due to fire,
        pandemic, virus, epidemic, travel advisories as to health, security
        and/or terrorism, flood, lockout, transportation delay, war, acts of
        God, governmental rule or order, strikes or other labor difficulties, or
        other causes beyond its reasonable control. However, in such an event,
        both parties will resume performance promptly after the cause of such
        delay or failure has been removed.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>10.8</strong> Assignment. Neither party may assign any of its
        rights or obligations under this Agreement without the other party's
        prior written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may assign any and all of
        its rights and obligations under this Agreement to a successor in
        interest in the event of a merger or acquisition or to an affiliate,
        upon written notice to the other party.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>10.9</strong> Independent Contractors. Nothing in this Agreement
        will be construed to imply a joint venture, partnership or
        principal-agent relationship between Company and Customer, and neither
        party will have the right, power or authority to obligate or bind the
        other in any manner whatsoever.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>10.10</strong> US Government Rights. The Services constitute and
        components thereof are a "commercial item" as that term is defined at 48
        C.F.R. § 2.101, consisting of "commercial computer software" and
        "commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are used in
        48 C.F.R. § 12.212. Accordingly, if Customer is an agency of the US
        government or any contractor therefore, Customer only receives those
        rights with respect to the Services as are granted to all other end
        users, in accordance with (a) 48 C.F.R. § 227.7201 through 48 C.F.R. §
        227.7204, with respect to the Department of Defense and their
        contractors, or (b) 48 C.F.R. § 12.212, with respect to all other US
        government users and their contractors.<br />
